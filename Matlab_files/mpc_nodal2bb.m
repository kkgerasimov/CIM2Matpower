function mpc_bb = mpc_nodal2bb(mpc_nodal_ORIGINAL)
%   MPC_NODAL2BB Transforms the Matpower case (mpc) file from NodeBreaker 
%       to BusBranch topology (based on the data from the original CIM files).
%
%       The NodeBreaker topology means that switches and breakers are 
%       represented as low-impedence branches. This model is used for 
%       optimization of switching actions (in the GARPUR project this is 
%       implemented in AMPL). However, sometimes the low-impedences might
%       cause the admittance matrix of the mpc to be ill conditioned and
%       thus the AC powerflow will not converge or will give wrong results.
%       In order to cope with this problem, this function can be used to
%       translate back the NodeBreaker to BusBranch model. 
%
%   INPUTS:
%       * mpc_nodal_ORIGINAL - mpc which is a NodeBreaker model. 
%
%   OUTPUTS:
%       * mpc_bb - mpc which is a BusBranch model.
